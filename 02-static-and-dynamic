Static: 
It means that something is determined at compile-time and does not change at runtime. 
Think of it like your birthday—it’s a fixed date that doesn’t change.

Dynamic:
It means that something can change at runtime based on different conditions or inputs. 
It's like your mood throughout the day—constantly changing based on what happens around you.

Static concepts are fixed and unchanging, while dynamic ones are flexible and adaptable.
