Procedural Programming: 
It focuses on a sequence of instructions to perform tasks. 
For example, making a sandwich by following step-by-step directions.

Functional Programming: 
It emphasizes functions that avoid changing states and mutable data. 
Think of it as a kitchen where every appliance is used for a specific task without altering any ingredients.

Object-Oriented Programming: 
It organizes code into objects that represent real-world entities, each with attributes (data) and methods (functions). 
It's like a chef with a toolbox where each tool has specific features and actions.
